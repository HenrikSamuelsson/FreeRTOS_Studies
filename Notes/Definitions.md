**Reentrancy** A function is called reentrant if it can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely called again ("re-entered") before its previous invocations complete execution. The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an external action such as a hardware interrupt or signal. Once the reentered invocation completes, the previous invocations will resume correct execution. Read more att (Wikipedia}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_%28computing%29].
