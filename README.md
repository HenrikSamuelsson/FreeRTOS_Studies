# FreeRTOS Studies
Notes and test programs related to learning FreeRTOS.  

FreeRTOS is a real-time kernel for embedded devices, that is supported by a large number of microcontroller families. It is distributed under the GPL with an optional exception. The exception permits users proprietary code to remain closed source while maintaining the kernel itself as open source, thereby facilitating the use of FreeRTOS in proprietary applications.
